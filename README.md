# Modern Renderer
This project aims to be an attempt at a modern renderer written in C++ with a C interface
utilizing Vulkan for the bulk of the rendering work.

## Contributing
Use the `.clang-format` for formatting your code. Some things to keep in mind:

 - `goto` and multi-line macros are strictly banned
 - Write tests for your code where applicable (obviously not all render work can have automated tests)
 - No esoteric names
 - Keep C++ crazy OOP nonsense to a minimum
 - Use snake_case for variables and functions, prefix methods with `m_` and use PascalCase for class/struct names
